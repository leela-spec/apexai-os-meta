Title: Learning Path | Hermes Agent

URL Source: https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/learning-path

Markdown Content:
Hermes Agent can do a lot — CLI assistant, Telegram/Discord bot, task automation, RL training, and more. This page helps you figure out where to start and what to read based on your experience level and what you're trying to accomplish.

Start Here

If you haven't installed Hermes Agent yet, begin with the [Installation guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/installation) and then run through the [Quickstart](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart). Everything below assumes you have a working installation.

First-time provider setup

First-time users almost always want `hermes setup --portal` — one OAuth covers a model plus the four Tool Gateway tools (search/image/TTS/browser). See [Nous Portal](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/integrations/nous-portal).

For most custom tool creation, start with plugins. The [Adding Tools](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/developer-guide/adding-tools) page is for built-in Hermes core development, not the usual user/custom-tool path.

### "I want to train models"[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/learning-path#i-want-to-train-models "Direct link to \"I want to train models\"")

Use reinforcement learning to fine-tune model behavior with Hermes Agent's RL training pipeline (powered by [Atropos](https://github.com/NousResearch/atropos)).

1.   [Quickstart](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart)
2.   [Configuration](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/configuration)

RL training works best when you already understand the basics of how Hermes Agent handles conversations and tool calls. Run through the Beginner path first if you're new.
