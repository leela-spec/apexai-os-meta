# /wiki-ingest — Two-Phase Source Ingestion

**Purpose**: Transform a raw source document (file or URL) into interlinked wiki pages.

**Invoked by**: `/wiki-ingest <file|URL>` → SKILL.md routes here

---

## Design Rationale

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`

- Two-phase ingest separates "what should we extract?" (analysis) from "how do we write it?" (generation). This gives the user a checkpoint to correct the LLM's understanding before pages are created, preventing garbage-in-garbage-out compounding.
- SHA-256 sentinel files (`cache/ingests/$HASH.done`) make re-ingestion idempotent — the same source can be dropped into `.raw/` again without duplicating pages. This is crucial for automated workflows (cron, watch-directory).
- The contradiction detection step (Phase 1, step 7) is the single most valuable quality lever — it catches inconsistent claims across pages before they become entrenched.

## Pre-Flight

### Step 0: Resolve Wiki Root

Determine the wiki root (from `SKILL.md` resolution rules):

1. `$LLM_WIKI_ROOT` environment variable
2. `wiki/` in current project
3. Ask user

### Step 1: Identify and Hash the Source

**If source is a file path:**

```bash
scripts/hash-files.sh <source_path>
```

**If source is a URL:**

- Use `WebFetch` to retrieve the content
- Pipe content through `sha256sum` to compute hash
- Store the fetched content as a temporary reference (or write to `.raw/` if configured)

### Step 2: Check if Already Ingested

```bash
test -f "$WIKI_ROOT/.llm-wiki/cache/ingests/$HASH.done"
```

If the sentinel file exists → **skip entirely**:

- Report: "This source was already ingested on {date}. Skipping."
- If the user wants to re-ingest: they should delete the sentinel file first.

## Phase 1 — Analysis

### Step 3: Read Context

Read these files to understand the current state of the wiki:

1. **`WIKI_SCHEMA.md`** (skill-level) — page types, field definitions, conventions
   - Path: `~/.claude/skills/llm-wiki/WIKI_SCHEMA.md`

2. **`.llm-wiki/index.md`** (project-level) — all existing pages, tags, summaries
   - Path: `$WIKI_ROOT/.llm-wiki/index.md`

3. **`.llm-wiki/config.md`** (project-level) — user settings (language, review preferences)
   - Path: `$WIKI_ROOT/.llm-wiki/config.md`

### Step 4: Read the Source Content

**If source is a file:** Read it directly.

**If source is a URL:** Use the already-fetched content from Step 1.

If the content is too large (>15,000 words), read it in chunks. For very large sources (books, long PDFs), suggest the user split it first.

### Step 5: Detect Language

Analyze the source content:

- Count CJK characters (Unicode U+4E00–U+9FFF)
- Count Latin characters (a-z, A-Z)
- `>70% CJK` → `zh`
- `>70% Latin` → `en`
- `30-70% mix` → `bilingual`

Store this as `SOURCE_LANGUAGE` for later steps.

### Step 6: Extract Key Elements

From the source, identify:

**Concepts** — terms, ideas, methodologies, tools worth having their own page:

- Is this term defined or explained in the source?
- Would someone encountering this term want to look it up?
- Does it already have a page in the wiki? (check index)

**Persons** — authors, researchers, notable figures mentioned:

- Are they central to the content?
- Do they already have a page?

**Key claims** — factual assertions worth preserving:

- Claims that would be useful in future queries
- Claims that might contradict existing wiki pages

**Structure** — how to organize the extracted knowledge:

- What would be the article page?
- What concepts need their own pages?
- What are the natural relationships?

### Step 7: Detect Contradictions

Compare extracted claims against existing wiki pages:

- For each key claim, search the index for related pages
- Read relevant existing pages and compare claims
- Flag any direct contradictions (two pages saying different things about the same fact)
- Flag any indirect contradictions (different interpretations or frameworks)

### Step 8: Write Phase 1 Analysis

Write the analysis to `$WIKI_ROOT/.llm-wiki/inbox/$HASH-analysis.md`:

```markdown
# Ingest Analysis — {source name}
**Source hash:** `$HASH`
**Language detected:** {en|zh|bilingual}
**Analyzed:** {ISO timestamp}

## Source Summary / 来源摘要
[2-3 sentence summary of the source content.]

## Concepts to Extract / 待提取概念
| Concept | Action | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| concept-name | create | New concept defined in source |
| existing-concept | update | New information to add |

## Persons to Create/Update / 待创建/更新的人物
| Person | Action | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| name | create | Key contributor |

## Pages to Create
| Filename | Type | Title | Key Content |
|----------|------|-------|-------------|
| ... | article | ... | ... |

## Contradictions Detected / 检测到的矛盾
| Existing Page | New Claim | Conflict |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| [[page-a]] | "Claim from source" | "Existing claim from page-a" |

## Proposed Cross-Links / 建议的交叉链接
- [[page-a]] ↔ [[new-page]] — relationship description

## Items for User Review / 待用户审核
- [ ] Decision point or question for the user
```

### Step 9: Present Analysis for Review

Show the user a summary of the analysis:

- Number of new concepts/pages to create
- Number of existing pages to update
- Any contradictions found
- Any decisions needed

**If `require_review: true` in config:** Wait for user approval before proceeding to Phase 2.

**If `require_review: false`:** Proceed automatically but still show the summary.

## Phase 2 — Generation

### Step 10: Create/Update Article Page

**If the source warrants an article page** (research notes, blog post, imported article):

1. Read `templates/article.md` from the skill directory
2. Create `$WIKI_ROOT/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.md`
3. Fill frontmatter:
   - `title`: Descriptive title (use bilingual format if source is bilingual)
   - `type: article`
   - `language`: from Step 5 detection
   - `created`, `modified`: today's date
   - `tags`: derived from content
   - `summary`: one-sentence overview
   - `source_url`: if URL source
   - `source_hash`: from Step 1
4. Fill body following the template structure
5. Include [[wikilinks]] to all related concept/person pages

### Step 11: Create/Update Concept Pages

For each concept identified in Phase 1:

**If creating a new concept page:**

1. Read `templates/concept.md`
2. Create `$WIKI_ROOT/{slug}.md`
3. Fill all required frontmatter
4. Write the body following the template
5. Include [[wikilinks]] to:
   - The source article page
   - Related concepts (existing or newly created)
   - Source references

**If updating an existing concept page:**

1. Read the current page
2. Add new information — do NOT overwrite existing content
3. Add a `> 📝 **Updated from [[source]]**: [what was added]` note at the end of the relevant section
4. Update `modified` date
5. Add new [[wikilinks]] as appropriate

### Step 12: Create/Update Person Pages

For each person identified in Phase 1:

**If creating a new person page:**

1. Read `templates/person.md`
2. Create `$WIKI_ROOT/{slug}.md`
3. Fill required frontmatter + any optional fields known
4. Write body following the template
5. Link to their work/concepts

**If updating:** Same pattern as concept updates (add, don't overwrite).

### Step 13: Cross-Link All Pages

After creating all new pages:

1. Re-read each newly created/updated page
2. For every [[wikilink]] from page A to page B, check if page B should link back
3. Add reverse links where appropriate
4. Ensure no orphan pages were created (every new page should have at least one incoming link)

### Step 14: Add Contradiction Callouts

For each contradiction found in Phase 1:

1. Add a contradiction callout block on both conflicting pages
2. Format per `WIKI_SCHEMA.md` conventions:

   ```markdown
   > ⚠️ **Contradiction / 矛盾**: [description]
   > | Page | Claim / 主张 |
   > |------|-------------|
   > | [[page-a]] | "Claim A" |
   > | [[page-b]] | "Claim B — contradicts A" |
   > *Detected: YYYY-MM-DD | Status: unresolved*
   ```

3. Add to `review.json` pending queue:

   ```json
   {"type": "contradiction", "pages": ["page-a", "page-b"], "description": "...", "detected": "YYYY-MM-DD"}
   ```

### Step 15: Regenerate Index

**This is a programmatic operation — do not edit index.md by hand.**

1. Read all `*.md` files in `$WIKI_ROOT/` (excluding `.llm-wiki/` and `index.md`)
2. Also read from `$WIKI_ROOT/topics/` if it exists
3. Extract frontmatter from each page (between `---` delimiters)
4. For each page, collect: slug, title, type, language, tags, summary, modified
5. Build the index following the format in `WIKI_SCHEMA.md`:
   - Header with timestamp and hash
   - All Pages table
   - By Tag sections
   - Orphan Pages section (run `scripts/find-orphans.sh`)
   - Review Queue section (from `review.json`)
6. Write to `$WIKI_ROOT/.llm-wiki/index.md`

### Step 16: Write Sentinel + Update Manifest

1. Create sentinel file:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p "$WIKI_ROOT/.llm-wiki/cache/ingests"
   echo "$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")" > "$WIKI_ROOT/.llm-wiki/cache/ingests/$HASH.done"
   ```

2. Update `source-manifest.json`:
   - Read existing manifest
   - Add entry: `{"$HASH": {"name": "source name", "date": "ISO timestamp", "language": "en|zh|bilingual", "pages_created": [...], "pages_updated": [...]}}`
   - Write back

3. Store index hash for staleness detection:

   ```bash
   scripts/check-stale.sh "$WIKI_ROOT"  # computes and stores hash
   ```

### Step 17: Report Summary

Present a clean summary to the user:

```
# Ingest Complete / 摄取完成

**Source:** {source name}
**Language:** {en|zh|bilingual}

## Created / 新建
| File | Type | Title |
|------|------|-------|
| ... | concept | ... |
| ... | article | ... |

## Updated / 更新
| File | What changed |
|------|-------------|

## Contradictions / 矛盾
{count} new contradictions flagged — run /wiki-lint to review

## Next Steps / 下一步
- Run /wiki-lint to check health
- Use /wiki-query to test the new knowledge
```

## Edge Cases

### Very Large Sources (>15,000 words)

- Process in chunks
- Write one analysis covering the entire source
- Consider suggesting the user split the source if it covers too many distinct topics

### Source in an Unsupported Format

- `.pdf`: Use `Read` tool with pages parameter (may need OCR for scanned PDFs)
- `.docx`, `.epub`: Suggest user convert to markdown or plain text first
- Images: Describe that text extraction requires OCR — suggest user provide text

### Source Already Partially Ingested

- If some concepts already have pages but the source has new information: update mode
- If the source is a newer version of a previously ingested source: treat as update
- Check `source-manifest.json` for related hashes

### Nested Directory Sources

- If the user ingests a directory: hash the entire directory, process files individually
- Create a parent article page that links to all generated sub-pages

### Conflicting with Existing Pages

- **Never silently overwrite.** Always preserve existing content and add new information alongside it.
- If a new claim directly contradicts an existing claim, add contradiction callouts to BOTH pages.
- If you're unsure, add to review queue and flag for user attention.

### Rate Limiting / Token Budget

- For very large ingests, break work across multiple sessions
- Use the hot-cache to track progress
- If interrupted, the sentinel file won't exist yet, so the source will be re-processed — Phase 1 analysis will be cached in `inbox/`
