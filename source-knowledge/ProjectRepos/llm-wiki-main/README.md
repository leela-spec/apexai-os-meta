A **Claude Code skill** that builds and maintains a persistent, interlinked wiki from your source documents. Based on Andrej Karpathy's [LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f).

Knowledge is compiled once and kept current, not re-derived on every query.

## Quick Start

### One Command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/6eanut/llm-wiki
cd llm-wiki
./quickstart.sh
```

That's it. The script installs the skill, initializes the wiki, and drops in demo source files (Greek mythology — optional, use `--no-demo` to skip).

After setup, start Claude Code and run:

```
/wiki-ingest .raw/greek-olympians.md
```

Then ask anything about the content — Claude checks the wiki automatically.

### With Session Hooks (Recommended)

```bash
./quickstart.sh --with-hooks
```

This enables:

- **Dynamic wiki stats at startup** — page count, recent changes, pending reviews injected at the start of every session
- **Hot-cache for session continuity** — context from your last session is bridged forward so you don't lose state between sessions

### Manual Setup

Prefer manual control? Here's the three-step version:

```bash
./llm-wiki/install.sh --force                                           # 1. Install skill
~/.claude/skills/llm-wiki/scripts/setup-project.sh ./wiki --with-hooks  # 2. Init wiki
# 3. Drop source files in .raw/ and run /wiki-ingest
```

### More Options

See the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/6eanut/llm-wiki/wiki/Quick-Start) on the wiki for troubleshooting and advanced configuration.

### What to Expect

After setup, start Claude Code in your project and ask a question:

```
You: "What is the relationship between Zeus and Athena?"

Claude: [reads ./wiki/.llm-wiki/index.md automatically]
        [finds relevant pages]
        [synthesizes answer with citations]

        ## Answer
        Athena is Zeus's daughter, born from his head...

        ## Evidence
        | Source Page | Key Point | Confidence |
        |-------------|-----------|------------|
        | [[athena]] | emerged from Zeus's forehead | high |
        | [[zeus]] | Father of Athena | high |
```

**You don't need to type `/wiki-query` for routine questions.** Claude reads CLAUDE.md at startup and follows the rule: "check the wiki before answering."

If the wiki doesn't have relevant knowledge, Claude will tell you and suggest adding source files to `.raw/`.

### Adding Your Own Knowledge

1. Drop source files (markdown, text) into `./.raw/`
2. Run `/wiki-ingest .raw/your-file.md`
3. The file is analyzed, concepts extracted, and interlinked pages created

## Architecture

### How Proactive Wiki Works

```
Session starts
    ↓
Claude reads CLAUDE.md → "Check the wiki before answering"
    ↓
SessionStart hook runs → wiki stats, topics, pending items
    ↓
Slash commands auto-discovered from ~/.claude/commands/
    ↓
Skill auto-registered as "wiki" from ~/.claude/skills/llm-wiki/
    ↓
User asks any question
    ↓
Claude reads index.md → finds relevant pages → answers with citations
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **CLAUDE.md for rules** | Always-loaded, no tool call needed. Tells Claude WHEN to use the wiki. |
| **SessionStart hook for state** | Dynamic wiki stats (pages, topics, pending items) injected each session. |
| **LLM is the runtime** | All content work done by Claude. No external language runtime needed. |
| **Bash for determinism only** | SHA-256 hashing, file listing, grep — correctness-critical operations only. |
| **Markdown workflow files** | Each command has a `workflows/*.md` procedure. Documentation = executable instructions. |
| **Two-phase ingest** | Phase 1 (analysis) writes a reviewable analysis before Phase 2 (generation) creates pages. |
| **Auto-generated index** | `index.md` regenerated on every change. Enables O(1) lookup of relevant pages. |
| **SHA-256 incremental caching** | `.done` sentinel files prevent re-ingestion. Safe to re-drop sources. |

### Three-Layer Data Architecture

```
.raw/ (sources)    →    wiki/ (pages)    →    skill (schema + workflows)
  (immutable)            (LLM-generated)       (conventions)
```

```

## Page Types

### `concept` — Define a term, idea, methodology, tool

```yaml
type: concept
language: en | zh | bilingual
```

Body: Definition → Key Properties → Examples → Related

### `article` — Notes, blog drafts, imported documents

```yaml
type: article
```

File: `YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md`

### `person` — Author, researcher, notable individual

```yaml
type: person
```

### `synthesis` — Saved query answer (the compounding mechanism)

```yaml
type: synthesis
query, based_on[], confidence: high | medium | low
```

File: `synth-YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md`

---

## Bilingual Support

- **Auto-detection**: CJK character ratio determines `zh` / `en` / `bilingual`
- **Page titles**: `"English / 中文"` format for bilingual pages
- **Cross-language wikilinks**: `aliases` field provides translations for link resolution
- **Query matching**: Prefers same-language pages, falls back across languages

## Compared to RAG

| | Typical RAG | LLM Wiki |
|---|-----|----------|
| Knowledge state | Re-derived per query | Persisted, compounding |
| Cross-references | None | Bidirectional [[wikilinks]] |
| Contradictions | Undetected | Flagged with callout blocks |
| Confidence | Opaque | Explicit per-page ratings |
| Audit trail | None | `based_on` provenance chain |
| Query cost | Every query reads source chunks | Index-first: only 3-5 pages read |
| Proactive | No — must be invoked | Yes — CLAUDE.md + hook drives behavior |

> Note: Advanced RAG implementations can include some of these features, but they're not standard. LLM Wiki provides them by design.

## Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **LLM is the runtime** | All content work done by Claude. No external language runtime needed. |
| **Bash for determinism** | SHA-256, grep, file listing — correctness-critical operations only. |
| **Auto-generated index** | Regenerated on every change. Never hand-edited. |
| **Incremental caching** | SHA-256 sentinel files prevent re-work. |
| **Two-phase ingest** | Human checkpoint between analysis and generation. |
| **Hot cache** | Multi-session context bridge via SessionStop/SessionStart hooks. |
| **True bilingual** | `language` field, CJK detection, cross-language aliases. |
| **Lint separation** | Quick (bash, free) vs Full (LLM, thorough) — pay only when needed. |
