# Query the Wiki

The user asked: `/wiki-query $ARGUMENTS`

## Procedure

### 1. Find wiki root

Check `./wiki/.llm-wiki/` — if missing, wiki needs to be initialized first.

### 2. Read the index

Read `./wiki/.llm-wiki/index.md` for the full page catalog (tags, titles, summaries, types).

### 3. Match query to pages

Find 3-5 most relevant pages by matching against tags, titles, and summaries.

### 4. Read pages and synthesize

- Read each relevant page
- Extract key claims and evidence
- Build an answer with:
  - Direct answer
  - Evidence table (page, key point, relevance, confidence)
  - Contradictions (if any)
  - Knowledge gaps
  - Confidence rating

### 5. Offer to save

After presenting the answer, offer to save as a synthesis page with `/wiki-save`.

### Full workflow

Use `Skill("llm-wiki")` → `workflows/query.md` for the complete procedure.
